        1) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" for classes but
        if you put all common functionalities into a single parent class
        the parent class will be so huge which we do not want it because
        "atomic structure" is recommended in coding.

        2) To be able to use "multiple inheritance" in Java, Java created "inheritance"
        structure. You can make multiple interfaces parent of a class, so
        for interfaces "multiple inheritance" is supported in Java.

        3) "interface" is "interface", "interface" is not a class
        4) "interface"s have common and mandatory functionalities
            interfaces are "to-do-list" for "consrete child classes".

         5) Methods in an interface
            i) All methods are "abstract" in an interface
            ii) All methods are "public" in an interface
            iii) All methods must be overriden by the concrete child classes

          6) Body part of methods can create issue for the child classes in
          multiple inheritance, but we do not have any concrete methods in interfaces
          that is why there is no confusion for child classes.

          7) Variable in an interface
            i) All variables are final in an interface
            ii) All variables are public in an interface
            iii) All variables are static in an interface

          8)"interface"s have abstract methods which are uncompleted codes that is why
           Java does not let create objects from an interface
           Note:"interface"s do not have constructors.

          9)You can use methods with the same name in parent interfaces, but return types
           of the methods must be same as well.

          10)Normally we cannot put "method with body" in an interface but by using
            two keywords we can create "method with body" in an interface
                i)default ==> It is not mandatory to override
                          ==> To use default methods create object from the concrete child class
                ii)static ==> It is not mandatory to override
                          ==> To use static methods no need to create object use interface name
           11)  child ==> parent
                Class ==>  Class : extends
                interface ==> interface : extends
                Class ==> interface : implements
                interface ==> Class : This is impossible, a Class cannot be the parent of an interface
